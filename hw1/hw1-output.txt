  *** Advice for Beginning Programmers  ***

"One must learn by doing the thing; for though
 you know it, you have no certainty until you try."
    -- Sophocles

"Computers are good at follwing instructions.
  but not at reading your mind."
  -- Donal Knuth

"The sooner you start to code, the longer the
 program will take."
 -- Roy Carlson

Problem 4

print('This program converts celsuis to fahrenhiet.')

celsius = float(input('degree celsuis:'))
fahrenheit = 9/5 * celsius + 32

print('Celsius to farhenheit is ' +str(fahrenheit))

Problem 4

This program converts celsuis to fahrenhiet.
degree celsuis:35.5
When celsius is converted to farhenheit it is 95.9
