Problem #5

This program tests the functions of the cylinder module.

Read the output carefully to check your functions.

For a cylinder of radius 1 and height 1, the volume
should be 3.142 and the surface area should be 12.566.
Computed values:  volume = 3.142, surface area = 12.566

For a cylinder of radius 0.1 and height 0.5, the volume
should be 0.016 and the surface area should be 0.377.
Computed values:  volume = 0.016, surface area = 0.377

For a cylinder of radius 2 and height 1.5, the volume
should be 18.850 and the surface area should be 43.982.
Computed values:  volume = 18.850, surface area = 43.982

For a cylinder of radius 0 and height 2, the volume should be 0
and the surface area should be 0.
Computed values:  volume = 0.000, surface area = 0.000
